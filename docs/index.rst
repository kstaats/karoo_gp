Welcome to Karoo GP
===================
Karoo GP is a Machine Learning application suite which provides both symbolic
regression and classification data analysis. Written in the programming
language Python, Karoo GP owes its foundation to the "Field Guide to Genetic
Programming" by Poli, Langdon, McPhee, and Koza.

Karoo GP is a scalable platform with multicore and GPU support, designed to
readily work with realworld data. No programming required. As a teaching tool,
it enables instructors to share step-by-step how an evolutionary algorithm
arrives to its solution. As a hands-on learning tool, Karoo GP supports rapid,
repeatable experimentation.

Karoo GP supports multiple programming workflows:

- **Text User Interface (TUI)**: An intuitive Desktop user interface and a
  fully scriptable Server interface with user defined default parameters and
  command-line arguments, both of which work with your datasets.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: An executable with optional flags which
  executes Karoo and reads and writes directly from/to the file directory.
- **API Libary**: A set of classes and functions which can be used to run Karoo
  in a Jupyter notebook environment or similar.
