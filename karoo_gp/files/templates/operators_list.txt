This file contains all operators supported by Karoo GP as of v2.5.

To apply one or more operator to a given run, copy/paste the desired operators from the USE IN KAROO table(s) below, 
into the associated file for Classification (files/operators_CLASSIFY.csv) or Regression (files/operators_REGRESS.csv)

* OPERATOR        EXAMPLE *
	add             a + b
	subtract        a - b
	multiply        a * b
	divide          a / b
	pow             a ** 2

* OPERATOR        EXAMPLE *
	logical_and     a and b
	logical_or      a or b
	logical_not     not a

* OPERATOR        EXAMPLE *
	abs             abs(a)
	exp             exp(a)
	expm1        expm1(a)
	log              log(a)
	log1p          log1p(a)
	sign            sign(a)
	square        square(a)
	sqrt             sqrt(a)

* OPERATOR        EXAMPLE *
	cos             cos(a)
	sin             sin(a)
	tan             tan(a)
	acos            acos(a)
	asin            asin(a)
	atan            atan(a)

USE IN KAROO
cos  
sin  
tan  
acos 
asin 
atan 

atan2(a,b) is NOT supported at this time.

The following operators produce TRUE or FALSE statements, and are therefore, at this time, not supported. A future 
version of Karoo will instead output a binary 1 or 0 instead.
		
	equal           a == b
	not_equal       a != b
	less            a < b
	less_equal      a <= b
	greater         a > b
	greater_equal   a >= 1
