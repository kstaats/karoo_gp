OPERATORS TESTED with Karoo GP v1.4

+,2
-,2
*,2
/,2
**,2

and,2
or,2
not,2


The following must be preceded by another operator due the manner in which Karoo flattens the trees into a 
mathematical expression. Else, Karoo will attempt a function such as (a)sin(b) where sin(b) is correct, but (a)sin 
requires an operator between the operand 'a' and the operator 'sin'. This will be addressed in a future update to Karoo. 

So, each of these must be presented as given in the following example:

+ abs,2
- abs,2
* abs,2
/ abs,2

+ log,2
- log,2
* log,2
/ log,2

+ log1p,2
- log1p,2
* log1p,2
/ log1p,2

+ sign,2
- sign,2
* sign,2
/ sign,2

+ square,2
- square,2
* square,2
/ square,2

+ sqrt,2
- sqrt,2
* sqrt,2
/ sqrt,2


The following operators produce TRUE or FALSE statements, and are therefore, at this time, not supported. A future
version of Karoo will instead output a binary 1 or 0 instead.

		equal           a == b
		not_equal       a != b
		less            a < b
		less_equal      a <= b
		greater         a > b
		greater_equal   a >= 1


The operator 'pow' requires the format 'pow(a, b)' which is not yet supported by Karoo GP.
